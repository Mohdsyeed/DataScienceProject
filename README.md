# DataScienceProject
Here I "Mohd Syeed Bhat" have created a Car Price Prediction project in Jupyter Notebook.
In which i have used Python Programming language and 
its libraries like numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn etc
which i used for Data Loading, Data Analysis, Data Cleaning etc
and I have used various Machine Learning Algorithms
by which I can predict the price of newly added cars to store on the basis of features.
